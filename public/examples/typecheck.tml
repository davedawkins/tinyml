//
// Types are inferred using a simple Hindley-Milner algorithm, as outlined in Tomas's course.
// I've 'enhanced' it slightly to capture symbol names. 

// You can hover over a symbol name and see its inferred type. You can also see inferred types
// in the AST viewer to the right. 

// I have a lot more to learn about type inference so this is a weak part of my implementation of TinyML
